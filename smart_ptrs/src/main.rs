    assert_eq!(*a, 5); // we are able to deref our MyBox instance
    // Behind the scenes, Rust actually ran the following code:
    // *(a.deref())
    // Rust substitutes the * operator with a call to the deref method
    // and then a plain dereference so we donâ€™t have to think about whether
    // or not we need to call the deref method. This Rust feature lets us
    // write code that functions identically whether we have a regular
    // reference or a type that implements Deref.

    // We can call the hello function with a string slice as an argument,
    // such as hello("Rust");, for example. Deref coercion makes it possible
    // to call hello with a reference to a value of type MyBox<String>
    hello("Rust");
    let m = MyBox::new("Rust");
    hello(&m);

    // Without deref coercion, we would have needed to write
    hello(&(*m)[..]);
    // The (*m) dereferences the MyBox<String> into a String. Then the &
    // and [..] take a string slice of the String that is equal to the whole
    // string to match the signature of hello. This code without deref
    // coercions is harder to read, write, and understand with all of these
    // symbols involved. Deref coercion allows Rust to handle these conversions
    // for us automatically.
